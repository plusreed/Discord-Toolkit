# This project is deprecated, I didn't have much time to work on it plus I don't want to really work on it anymore. Sorry.

# Discord-Toolkit

A WIP CLI-based Discord.

### Features
* On-the-fly status switching (`afk`)
* _(WIP)_ Discord cvars

### Coming Soonâ„¢
* Define your own cvars
* Switch Discord profile picture
* Streaming statuses (maybe use `set` to do these?)
* Chatting in Discord guilds (maybe use the cvars so the user doesn't have to remember the guild ID)
* First-time setup (autogen config.json)

### Dependencies
* vorpal
* discord.js
