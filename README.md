Discord-Toolkit
---
A WIP CLI-based Discord.

###Features
* On-the-fly status switching (`afk`)
* _(WIP)_ Discord cvars

###Coming Soon™
* Define your own cvars
* Switch Discord profile picture
* Streaming statuses (maybe use `set` to do these?)
* Chatting in Discord guilds (maybe use the cvars so the user doesn't have to remember the guild ID)
* First-time setup (autogen config.json)

###Dependencies
* vorpal
* discord.js
